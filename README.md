### <a name="docker">Setting up in a CMSSW Docker container (Open Data Users)</a>

The following are instructions on how to set up and compile the code on a CMSSW docker container, with `CMSSW_X_X_X`. (Select the container version according to the recommendation for each year.)

Start a docker container following the [instruction](https://opendata.cern.ch/docs/cms-guide-docker).

##### WITHIN the docker container

Once (first time only):

Clone the GitHub repository to `NanoAOD/NanoAnalyzer/`:
```
git clone https://github.com/cms-opendata-analyses/NanoAODRun1ProducerTool.git NanoAOD/NanoAnalyzer/
```

`NanoAOD/NanoAnalyzer/` is the name of the folder. The code wonâ€™t compile if it is not cloned to this folder.

If you are already in the `CMSSW_X_X_X/src` directory,

Every time:
```
cmsenv
```

If not,
```
cd CMSSW_X_X_X/src
cmsenv
```

Every time
```
cd NanoAOD/NanoAnalyzer
```

Here you will now find the content of the repository.

Technically, the NanoAnalyzer is a so-called EDAnalyzer
(originally set up with mkdanlzr).

To compile:
```
scram b
```

For a successful compilation, you should see something like:
```
>> Local Products Rules ..... started
>> Local Products Rules ..... done
>> Building CMSSW version CMSSW_4_2_8 ----
>> Entering Package NanoAnalyzer/src
>> Leaving Package NanoAnalyzer/src
>> Package NanoAnalyzer/src built
>> Entering Package NanoAnalyzer/pytest
>> Leaving Package NanoAnalyzer/pytest
>> Package NanoAnalyzer/pytest built
>> Entering Package NanoAnalyzer/tools
>> Leaving Package NanoAnalyzer/tools
>> Package NanoAnalyzer/tools built
>> Entering Package NanoAnalyzer/files
>> Leaving Package NanoAnalyzer/files
>> Package NanoAnalyzer/files built
>> Subsystem NanoAnalyzer built
>> Local Products Rules ..... started
>> Local Products Rules ..... done
gmake[1]: Entering directory `/home/cmsusr/CMSSW_4_2_8'
>> All python modules compiled
>> Pluging of all type refreshed.
gmake[1]: Leaving directory `/home/cmsusr/CMSSW_4_2_8'
```

#### Whenever you want to update the code to the latest version (not first time)

In the `NanoAOD/NanoAnalyzer/` directory, 

get the updates from github
```
git pull
```

#### Run NanoAODAnalyzer
	
Example configuration files for different years of data and simulation are found in the files called `nanoanalyzer_cfg_20*.py`. Choose an appropriate example for your container and data format. Run it using: 
```
cmsRun nanoanalyzer_cfg_<year><Data or MC>.py
```

e.g. `nanoanalyzer_cfg_2010Data.py` for 2010 7 TeV pp AOD data (similar for 0.9 TeV) or `nanoanalyzer_cfg_2015miniMC.py` for 2015 13 TeV pp miniAOD MC.

Note:

The configurations for the 2015 data have been technically validated, but not yet been validated for content. 

Run2 UL data have not yet been released.

Official CMS NanoAOD will be the main reference for these.
