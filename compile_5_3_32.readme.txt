The following are instructions on how to set up and compile the code on 
an sl7 cms workgroup server at DESY, with CMSSW_5_3_32 (2011/12 data and MC).
They will be complemented by instructions for other configurations.

  open a "fresh" xterm window on your sl7 machine:
xterm &

once (1st time only):
---------------------
install grid certificate (userkey.pem) in .globus
set permissions to _r_______

every time:
-----------
   initialize cms grid proxy: (might need to repeat later if proxy expired)
voms-proxy-init -voms cms
give passphrase

   initialize cmssw environment:
module use -a /afs/desy.de/group/cms/modulefiles
module load cmssw

   start singularity shell:
cmssw-cc6 --bind /nfs:/nfs
          the latter is for access to the local disk area /nfs/dust
   check release (optional):
Singularity> cat /etc/redhat-release
           -> CentOS release 6.10 (Final)
   set cms defaults:
Singularity> source /cvmfs/cms.cern.ch/cmsset_default.sh
   check compiler version (optional):
Singularity> echo $SCRAM_ARCH
           -> slc6_amd64_gcc700  
   (might be reset to slc6_amd64_gcc472 upon cmsrel later)

once (first time only):
----------------------- 
   on the top directory in which you would like to install the code,
   (dot *not* mkdir the CMSSW directory beforehand) 
   create the CMSSW 5_3_32 environment:
cmsrel CMSSW_5_3_32 
   (ignore potential "Release ... is not available" error message)
   this will create the corresponding directory with subdirectories

every time:
-----------
cd CMSSW_5_3_32/src

    make sure you have access rights to CERN git.
    (if you do not have them yet the git clone command will give an error)
    e.g., for access via your CERN kerberos token:
kinit "yourCERNusername"@CERN.CH

once (first time only):
-----------------------
    in the src directory, set up .../CMSSW_5_3_32/src/NanoAOD/NanoAnalyzer/:
git clone https://:@gitlab.cern.ch:8443/cms-opendata/cms-opendata-nanoaodplus/nanoaodplus_v1.git NanoAOD/NanoAnalyzer

every time
----------
cd NanoAOD/NanoAnalyzer
   here you will now find the content of
   https://gitlab.cern.ch/cms-opendata/cms-opendata-nanoaodplus/nanoaodplus_v1
   thechnically, the NanoAnalyzer is a so-called EDAnalyzer
   (originally set up with mkdanlzr)

   to compile:
scram b
