The following are instructions on how to set up and compile the code on 
an sl7 cms workgroup server on lxplus or at DESY, 
with CMSSW_4_2_8 (2010 data and MC).

  open a "fresh" xterm window on your sl7 machine at DESY or CERN:
xterm &
  or
ssh lxplus.cern.ch

once (1st time only, might only be needed later to access files for running):
---------------------
install grid certificate (userkey.pem) in .globus
set permissions to _r_______

every time:
-----------
   initialize cms grid proxy: 
   (can do later, might need to repeat later if proxy expired)
voms-proxy-init -voms cms
give passphrase

   at DESY only (no action needed on lxplus):
   initialize cmssw environment:
module use -a /afs/desy.de/group/cms/modulefiles
module load cmssw

   start sl5 singularity shell:
   at DESY:
cmssw-env --cmsos slc5 --bind /nfs:/nfs
                      the latter is for access to the local disk area /nfs/dust
   on lxplus:
cmssw-env --cmsos slc5

   check release (optional):
Singularity> cat /etc/redhat-release
           -> Scientific Linux CERN SLC release 5.11 (Boron)
   set cms defaults:
Singularity> source /cvmfs/cms.cern.ch/cmsset_default.sh
   check compiler version (optional):
Singularity> echo $SCRAM_ARCH
           -> slc5_amd64_gcc481  
   (will be reset to slc5_amd64_gcc434 upon cmsrel later)

once (first time only):
----------------------- 
   on the top directory in which you would like to install the code,
   (dot *not* mkdir the CMSSW directory beforehand) 
   create the CMSSW 4_2_8 environment:
cmsrel CMSSW_4_2_8 
   (ignore potential "Release ... is not available" error message)
   this will create the corresponding directory with subdirectories

every time:
-----------
cd CMSSW_4_2_8/src

    make sure you have access rights to CERN git.
    (if you do not have them yet the git clone command will give an error)
    e.g., for access via your CERN kerberos token:
kinit "yourCERNusername"@CERN.CH
    (if kinit does not exist on singularity, do it on the "parent" sl7 window)

once (first time only):
-----------------------
    in the src directory, set up .../CMSSW_5_3_32/src/NanoAOD/NanoAnalyzer/:
git clone https://:@gitlab.cern.ch:8443/cms-opendata/cms-opendata-nanoaodplus/nanoaodplus_v1.git NanoAOD/NanoAnalyzer

every time
----------
cd NanoAOD/NanoAnalyzer
   here you will now find the content of
   https://gitlab.cern.ch/cms-opendata/cms-opendata-nanoaodplus/nanoaodplus_v1
   technically, the NanoAnalyzer is a so-called EDAnalyzer
   (originally set up with mkdanlzr)

whenever you want to update the code to the latest version (not first time) 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
git pull

   to compile:
scram b
(ignore ****WARNING: Invalid tool EgammaAnalysis/ElectronTools. Please fix src/NanoAOD/NanoAnalyzer/BuildFile.xml file.)
